Why do you need  DOTWEB3.0-Jstar  encryption?
===========================================

Since  in   today  circumstances   many  industries,  banking  websites ,etc  are  attacked  

by  Hackers  or  worm  or virus.

When   JSTAR  server  compiles  .jstar  file   it  generates   .BS  file  (encrypted  file ).

so  user  can  type  .BS  and  get the  output.

That .BS  file   is not  understood by  hackers   even  .class   is  understood  by  hackers...

so  .BS  is    followed  for    Security   web  design.
