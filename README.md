What  do you meant  by JX-MEM RemoteWebapplication?
===================================================


It is the remotewebapplication using Vast Memory management

using JWEB Technology...

eg) J$MEM , J$WEBMEM are the examples...


When it was Invented? Who invented it?

JWEB  project took place from year 2014 to  2017. And it is first  invented at year 2014.
And modified in C/C++ and  C#  P.L And completly invented at year 2017.
It is invented by wilmix jemin j at C/C++ P.L,CH$, java, and  C# P.L.
And  CH$ is   the  main  reason for  creating   remoteserver  for  JDollar.

but DOTWEB3.0-cdollar  is   invented  in java p.l.

What   will  happen  when you  create   remoteserver in  java?

It will   take    2   years  to complete.

DOTWEB3.0   can   create a  remoteserver in   4 hours.


It uses DOTWEB3.0 -java runtime to run the programs.
